# Burn the Constitution



To emphasize the commonality
of the 99 percent, to declare deep enmity of interest with the 1 percent, is to do exactly what the
governments of the United States, and the wealthy elite allied to them-from the Founding Fathers to
now-have tried their best to prevent. Madison feared a "majority faction" and hoped the new
Constitution would control it. He and his colleagues began the Preamble to the Constitution with
the words "We the people ...," pretending that the new government stood for everyone, and hoping
that this myth, accepted as fact, would ensure "domestic tranquility."
