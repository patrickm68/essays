# Burn the Constitution



To emphasize the commonality
of the 99 percent, to declare deep enmity of interest with the 1 percent, is to do exactly what the
governments of the United States, and the wealthy elite allied to them-from the Founding Fathers to
now-have tried their best to prevent. Madison feared a "majority faction" and hoped the new

## The solution

- Stop holding a highly flawed and vague document as an infallible religious text. 
- Stop glorifying the framers as enlightened beings, when in reality they were the class enemies of the workers then, just as much as now. 
- Realize that bourgeois political processes cannot reform the constitution. Improvements only occur when politicians are threatened by violence and instability.
