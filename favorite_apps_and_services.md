# Favorite apps and services



## Goals

- Privacy conscious, [end-to-end encrypted (E2EE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption).
- Decentralized, **no reliance** on cloud providers like Google, Microsoft, Apple, Spotify, Netflix, etc. 
- Self-hosted and self-reliant, simple files preferred.
- Make sure no sites / services are US based.



## Media

- Download all music / movies locally, using torrents behind a VPN. ([Don't use Tor for torrenting, it won't work and will just put unnecessary load to the Tor network](https://blog.torproject.org/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea))
  - Use [AirVPN](https://airvpn.org/), [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/), [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/), [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/) 
  - Use [qbittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/), [deluge](https://www.deluge-torrent.org/), or [transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/) for a torrent client.
- Use [MPV](https://mpv.io/) or [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html), open source media players to play media.
- Use [emby](https://emby.media/) for streaming to other devices. 



## Documents

- Write all documents and notes in markdown.
  - Use [typora](https://typora.io/), [Mark Text](https://marktext.github.io/website/), or [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) as markdown and code editors.
- Spreadsheets in [Libreoffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/).
- Install [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/), and put all your documents in a synced folder. 

## Tasks

- Use a [todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/) file for a personal task list, synced with syncthing.
  - [QTodoTxt](http://qtodotxt.org/) as a desktop client, [Simpletask Cloudless](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.mpcjanssen.simpletask&hl=en_US) for Android.
- For shared task lists, use [Etherpad](http://etherpad.org/).



## Collaboration

- Use [Etherpad](http://etherpad.org/).



## Browsing

- Use Firefox or Tor Browser, with the addons:
  - [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)
  - [HTTPS Everywhere](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/https-everywhere)
  - [Privacy Badger](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger17)
  - [Facebook Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-container) - As suggested, this keeps all Facebook stuff in it's own Firefox container.
  - [Google Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/google-container/) - The above, but for Google.
- [Startpage](https://www.startpage.com/), [Searx](https://searx.me/) ([onion service](http://searchb5a7tmimez.onion/)), or [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) ([onion service](https://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/)) as a search engine
- If using Tor, use onion services if possible instead of clearnet.


## Passwords

- Use [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/).
  - Install the Firefox KeePassXC plugin.
  - Use a long master pass phrase, with at least 10 words. 
- Sync your password file everywhere you need using syncthing.



## Chat

- Use [Signal](https://www.signal.org/) or Matrix / [Riot](https://about.riot.im/).
- Use [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/) for email, e2ee with pgp if possible.



## Social Media

- [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/), [GNU Social](https://gnu.io/social/), or [diaspora*](https://diasporafoundation.org/)



## Operating system

- Use Linux, preferably Arch Linux or a variant.
