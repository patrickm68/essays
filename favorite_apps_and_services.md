# Favorite apps and services
## Goals
- Privacy conscious, [end-to-end encrypted (E2EE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption).
- Decentralized, **no reliance** on cloud providers like Google, Microsoft, Apple, Spotify, Netflix, etc. 
- Self-hosted and self-reliant, simple files preferred over running services.
- Make sure no sites / services are US based.

## Media
- Download all music / movies locally, using torrents behind a VPN. ([Don't use Tor for torrenting, it won't work and will just put unnecessary load to the Tor network](https://blog.torproject.org/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea))
  - Use [AirVPN](https://airvpn.org/), [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/), [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/), [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/) 
  - Use [qbittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/), [deluge](https://www.deluge-torrent.org/), or [transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/) for a torrent client.
- Use [MPV](https://mpv.io/) or [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html), open source media players to play media.
- Use [jellyfin](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin) or SFtp for streaming to other devices. 
- Instead of centralized, hosted youtube alternatives with upload limits, use torrents, and find a platform to post and comment on the magnet links.

## Documents and Coding
- Write all documents and notes in markdown.
  - Use [Typora](https://typora.io/), [Mark Text](https://marktext.github.io/website/), or vim as markdown editors / notes. 
  - Use vim with [vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc) and [Youcompleteme](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe) for code.
    - Do not use vscode, it's [difficult to impossible to turn off keylogging.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40451596/visual-studio-code-still-accessing-internet-after-update-and-telemetry-was-disab). If you must, use [VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium#why-does-this-exist), which removes the built-in telemetry.
- Spreadsheets in [Libreoffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/).
- Install [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/), and put all your documents in a synced folder. 

## Tasks / Todos
- Use a [todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/) file for a personal task list, synced with syncthing.
  - [QTodoTxt](http://qtodotxt.org/) as a desktop client, [Simpletask Cloudless](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.mpcjanssen.simpletask&hl=en_US) for Android.
- For shared task lists, use [Etherpad](http://etherpad.org/).
- No good solution yet for calendars, really wish there were good file-based calendar apps.

## Collaboration
- Use [Etherpad](http://etherpad.org/).

## Browsing
- Use Firefox or Tor Browser, with the addons:
  - [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)
  - [Privacy Badger](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger17)
  - [Facebook Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-container) - Keeps all Facebook stuff in it's own container.
  - [Google Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/google-container/)
- [Startpage](https://www.startpage.com/), [Searx](https://searx.me/) ([onion service](http://searchb5a7tmimez.onion/)), as a search engine
- If using Tor, use onion services if possible.


## Passwords
- Use [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/). 
  - Install the Firefox KeePassXC plugin.
  - Use a long master pass phrase, with at least 10 words. 
- Sync your password file everywhere you need using Syncthing.

## Chat
- Use Matrix /  [Riot](https://about.riot.im/), or [Signal](https://www.signal.org/). 
- Use [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/) for email, e2ee with pgp if possible.

## Social Media
- Twitter alternative : [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/)
- Facebook : [Friendica](https://friendi.ca/)
- Reddit : [PostMill](https://gitlab.com/edgyemma/Postmill), or [Lobste.rs](https://github.com/lobsters/lobsters)
- Medium : [Plume](https://github.com/Plume-org/Plume)
