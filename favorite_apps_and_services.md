# Favorite apps and services

## Goals

- Privacy conscious, [end-to-end encrypted (E2EE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption).
- Decentralized, **no reliance** on cloud providers like Google, Microsoft, Apple, Spotify, Netflix Youtube, etc. 
  - Self-hosted and self-reliant.
  - Simple files preferred over running services.
- Make sure no sites / services are [US based.](https://www.privacytools.io/providers/#ukusa)

## Media

- Download all music / movies locally, using torrents, behind a VPN. ([Don't use Tor for torrenting](https://blog.torproject.org/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea))
  - Use [AirVPN](https://airvpn.org/), [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/), [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/), [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/) 
  - Use [qbittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/), [deluge](https://www.deluge-torrent.org/), or [transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/) for PC, [LibreTorrent](https://github.com/proninyaroslav/libretorrent) for android.
- Use [MPV](https://mpv.io/) or [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html), open source media players to play media.
- Use [Jellyfin](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin) or SFTP for streaming to other devices.
- Instead of centralized, hosted youtube alternatives with upload limits, use torrents, and find a platform to post and comment on the magnet links.

## Documents and Coding

- Install [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/), and put all your documents in a synced folder. 
- Write all documents and notes in [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
  - Use [Typora](https://typora.io/), [Mark Text](https://marktext.github.io/website/), or vim as markdown editors / notes. 
- Use vim with [vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc) and [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) for code.
  - Do not use vscode, it's [difficult to impossible to turn off keylogging](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40451596/visual-studio-code-still-accessing-internet-after-update-and-telemetry-was-disab). If you must, use [VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium#why-does-this-exist), which removes the built-in telemetry.
- Spreadsheets in [Libreoffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/).

## Tasks / Todos

- Use a [todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/) file for a personal task list, synced with syncthing.
  - [QTodoTxt](http://qtodotxt.org/) as a desktop client, [todo.txt-vim](https://github.com/freitass/todo.txt-vim), [Simpletask Cloudless](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.mpcjanssen.simpletask&hl=en_US) for Android.
