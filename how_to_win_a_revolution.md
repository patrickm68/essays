## The Crisis
Short description of why capitalism is bad, why reformism doesn't work, and why revolution is necessary. A short description also of the path, as given in Lenin's S+R. We won't know how the world will exactly look without wage slavery, whether it will be a bookchin-like communalism, or TODO include picture fully automated luxury gay space communism.
## 
## What is a Revolution?
### The Ruling, and the Ruled
Property relations. Who controls the means of production, and how this is organized.
When one group of people overthrows another, to become the new dominant, ruling class. "Political Revolutions" and "Coups" are often not revolutions at all. Replacing one military dictator, with another, without changing the class-nature of the power structure, isn't a revolution. 
## Conditions
### Dissatisfaction
What is this pointed at? Minorities? The ruling class? Where is the rage directed at? Where the rage gets directed, is where the guns get pointed.
### Solidarity / Class Conciousness
#### Unified class interests
#### Comradery, and friendship
#### Social Justice
### Armed population
### Leadership
#### Organization
#### Decision-making


## Strategy
### Organizing
Why organizing is necessary. Use trotskys article on why individual terrorism is bad. Need class nature.
#### Political Parties
#### Unionism in the 21st century
#### Spreading the message
Pablo iglesias video, language and propaganda. Agitprop. Memes.
### Location
Why the countryside / forests is no longer a viable 'cover' for guerilla warfare. Guerillas need safety, and protection, IE, cover, can't have meetings and organize, no rifle practice. David Kilcullen video, 45:45. Max Boot on guerilla warfare. Traditionally guerillas weren't successful in cities. Today we have foliage penetrating radar that can see through forests, Drones that can surveil mountain ranges 24 hours a day. No more cover in the rural environment anymore, the cover is in the cities. Governments try to understand the information about cities, knowing who people are, where they live, where they go. These pieces of information can be obfuscated and made confusing. 

The cover areas must be in slums, or 'illegible' territory, IE areas where capital has no vision.
### Strikes
Workers councils in the 21st century don't have the same power as they did in earlier times. Automation, and a labor surplus means that workers tactics like strikes, sit-ins, aren't as effective as in earlier times.
### Arming
### Fighting
#### Tech
Syrian rebels using android phones to control mortars. Drones. Self-created armored vehicles, alshams, miniature lightweight, home-made tank. Remote controlled machine gun, with armored video cameras. Consumer electronics, urban environment, democratized military tech. David kilcullen out of the mountains youtube, 26:21. OpenStreetMaps for strategy.
### Winning the battle of public opinion
In 2010, Kilcullen brought together his writings in his book Counterinsurgency and developed his understanding of counterinsurgency to address the globalized threat of radical Islam. He argues that successful counterinsurgency is about out-governing the enemy and winning the adaptation battle to provide integrated measures to defeat insurgent tactics through political, administrative, military, economic, psychological and informational means.
Everything that the city/government does, you have to provide an alternative to do better. Free breakfast, etc.

Too early, and you'll blow it, or be destroyed.
### Defeating the counter-revolution

### Compromises

## What to do next?


Extra:
- Talk about how in russia, the conscripted soldiers aligned with the workers, and the army was pissed off at the government. Conversely in Cuba, the army actively suppressed the people, and an insurgency was necessary.
