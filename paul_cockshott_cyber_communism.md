# Paul Cockshott - Cyber-Communism

Taken from his book, [Towards a New Socialism](http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/socialism_book/), [audiobook here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjHCPWs5sl4&list=PL0-IkmzWbjoZNiItBbuVvKQBdE80tsyhx), and specifically his youtube lectures [Going beyond Money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI01-5zhwdA), and [Getting down to details](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTl4b0w6mpk).

## How it works

- Production takes place. All goods / services are valued by their **composite labor time** (in labor voucher hours, see below). Factor in depreciation and education into cost. For example, a smartphone might cost 0.5 labor hours. Goods that have neglible marginal cost (~ 0 labor hours) would be free.
- Open, publicly funded research and development is shared by all, with the goal of **decreasing the labor time cost** of every good.
- Workers are paid in labor vouchers **per hour work performed**. Working 8 hours would earn you 8 LVH (labor voucher hours). Multipliers *may* be used if certain work is deemed more necessary, or dangerous, but most likely limited by a certain ratio to foster community.
- Goods are sold in public shops.
- Shop managers are instructed to **adjust labor prices so that all goods are sold**. While a good selling out is itself an indicator of demand, adjusting by a certain limited ratio gives more demand information, and prevents unwanted goods from going to waste. 
- Each good now has a ratio of its *sold labor time* to actual labor time cost. 
- If goods are selling *above* their actual labor cost (ratio > 1), that means society wants *more* labor allocated to produce that good. Below that means they want less labor allocated.
- Planners adjust output targets based on this demand. 
- Planners do material balances to derive gross output requirements (raw materials + intermediate materials + labor). Input-output tables are solved using linear algebra. 
- They compare these requirements with the *actual resources* available. Some of these might be set by environmental constraints, or limited quantities.
- Population uses direct democracy to vote on how much labor to allocate to non-consumer goods (see below).
- They see if the final output targets can be met, and if not, go back to the adjust output targets step.
- Finally, form a detailed production plan, broadcast it over the internet to all productive facilities, monitor production (and sales) in real-time. Adjust plan accordingly.

## Essentials

### Labor vouchers

- Earned by workers. 1 LVH = 1 Labor Voucher Hour earned per hour of work.
- Attached to a single person / family, likely through a credit card. 
- Can only be exchanged for consumer goods. You cannot transfer them to another person. Buying absentee property is illegal. 
- Are destroyed after being used in shops.
- Possibly destroyed after a certain amount of time (to prevent hoarding)
- Labor time across the economy is preserved. If there are 6 million working people in a country : 
  - Labor ministry issues 6 million person-years vouchers to workers. 
  - Labor hours used producing non-consumer goods (2 million person-years) + labor hours used in consumer goods production (4 million person-years) = cost of goods in shops (4 million person-years) + (2 million person-years cancelled for social tax bin)
  - Workers spend 4 million in the shops, social income tax of 2 million ( to provide for social services ), and the 6 million labor hours are fully canceled. 
  - This defetishizes consumer-producer relations, since you can see exactly how human labor is being allocated, and spent.

### Direct democracy for non-consumer goods

- New enterprises, entertainment, research and development, social services are all examples of non-consumer goods. 
- Society votes on how much labor to devote to social services: education, health care, child care, environmental protection, national defense. If a country has 6 million adult workers, it might allocate 2 million people to non-consumer goods.
- Major strategic decisions taken democratically by all the interested population. Minor decisions left to planners. Information open to all, voting available to all.
