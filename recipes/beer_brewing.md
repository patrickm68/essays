## Instructions

### Mash

- [Go here](https://www.morebeer.com/content/sparge_water_calculator) to calculate total water, mash water, sparge water, strike temperature, and pre-boil wort.
  - Mash water should usually be around 3.38 Gallons at 164 deg.
  - Sparge water should be around 5.16 Gallons at 170-180 deg.
- Heat ~ 6 gallons of water to mash temp.
- Use 1.5 galllons to heat up mash tun. Leave in for 10 minutes, then pour out.
- Line Mash tun with clothing bag liner.
- Pour in mash water from kettle to mash tun using big cup.
- Pour in grains, stir.
- Put on lid, cover in blanket / beach towel.
- Leave for 1 hour.
- Meanwhile, fill up kettle again and bring your sparge water up to 170-180 deg.
- Pour this out into other containers (your kettle is now your brew kettle and should be empty)
- Start draining mash tun (recirculate until its clear).
- Drain into kettle until empty.
- Once it gets low, your sparge water. Recirculate every time. Repeat until all sparge water is used.
- Save 1 qt of this into a container for a yeast starter.
- Take sample from kettle, chill in fridge, and measure the specific gravity, should be around 1.040.

### Boil

- Measure pre-boil volume.
- Boil kettle. 
- Boil for 75 minutes total
- Stir in hops after 60 minutes (15 minutes left to go)
- Sanitize your immersion chiller if you have one.
- Add 1 teaspoon irish moss
- After 75 minutes, use immersion or sink ice bath + stirring to chill below 85 deg. Try not to splash when hot (hot aeration).
- Now take sample for post-boil gravity / original gravity. Make sure stuff is sanitized. Put in fridge.
- Measure post-boil volume.
- Calculate brew-house efficiency.
- After chilled, stir / whirlpool the beer, to get all the gunk to collect at the center. 
- Raise kettle up, siphon beer to fermenter. Ideally about 5.5 gallons. Splash a lot to aerate.
- Check post-boil specific gravity from fridge sample. Should be about 1.052. 

### Yeast starter

- 2 cups of water, 1/2 cup of dried malt extract, into a pot. Or 1 qt of pre-boil wort. 
- Check the gravity of this liqid and dilute to 1.020 - 1.030, usually about 1.75 qt. 
- Boil for 10 mins. 
- Pour into plastic or pyrex container. 
- Cool in ice bath or fridge to 59-68 deg. 
- Aerate / stir / splash a lot. 
- Pour in yeast. 
- Swirl it. Stir occasionally. Leave for 2-3 days before pitching into wort. 



### Ferment

- Make sure its at room temperature, 60-75 deg, and aerated.
- Swirl yeast starter, add to fermenter.
- 12 hours later, it should seem pretty active, foamy, etc. 
- Usually about 2 weeks primary, 2 weeks secondary, 2 weeks bottling. 
- Check final gravity.
- Go [here](https://www.brewersfriend.com/brewhouse-efficiency/) and calculate your brewhouse efficiency. Or `ABV = (OG-FG)/.00753`
- [Here's](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-check-and-control-alcohol-levels-the-kitchns-beer-school-2015-217260) what you can do for adjusting numbers. 
- Stir in priming sugar. 
- Bottle.
