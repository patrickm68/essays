### For the dough

- 14g salt + 50g water
- 475g water
- 700g bread flour
- 2 cast iron pots

## Instructions

- The night before, combine all the ingredients of the leaven, and mix to form a thick batter. Place in a large bowl and cover overnight.
- Combine 14g salt and 50g of water in a small bowl, mix, and set aside.

- Pour the salt-water into the bowl, pinching and squeezing into the dough.
- Fold the dough by lifting it up, pulling it over, then rotating the bowl 90°. Fold it 4 times (rotating 4 times). Repeat these 4 folds every 20 minutes, 6 times, 2 hours total.
- Let the dough rise another 30 minutes. 
- Sprinkle some flour on the counter, pour the dough onto it, and split into two equal loaves with a bench scraper.
- Work these into rounds by "turning left while driving", and place them on the counter, covered.
- Let rise for 2.5 hours. 
- Work them into rounds again.
- Score the tops of the loaves with a knife, a cross works.
- Heat oven to 500°.
